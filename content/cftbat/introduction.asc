= The Programming Language You've Been Longing For

_*Clojure!*_

For weeks, _months_ &mdash; no! _from the very moment you were born_
&mdash; you've felt it calling to you. Every time you've held your
keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class
hierarchy; every time you've lain awake at night, disturbing your
loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a
race condition has caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling
hair, some secret part of you has known that _there has to be a better
way_.
