          <p>For weeks, <em>months</em> — no! <em>from the very moment you were born</em>
            — you've felt it calling to you. Every time you've held your
            keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class
            hierarchy; every time you've lain awake at night, disturbing your
            loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a
            race condition has caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling
            hair, some secret part of you has known that <em>there has to be a better
              way</em>.</p>
