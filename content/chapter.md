# Do Things: a Clojure Crash Course

It's time to to learn how to actually *do things* with Clojure! Hot
damn!

While you've undoubtedly heard of Clojure's awesome concurrency
support and other stupendous features, Clojure's most salient
characteristic is that it is a Lisp. In this chapter, you're going to
explore the elements which comprise this Lisp core: syntax, functions,
and data. This will provide you with a solid foundation for
representing and solving problems in Clojure.

This groundwork will also allow you to write some super important
code. In the last section, you'll tie everything together by creating
a model of a hobbit and writing a function to hit it in a random spot.
Super! Important!

As you go through the chapter, I recommend that you type out the
examples in a REPL and run them. Programming in a new language is a
skill, and, just like yodeling or synchronized swimming, you have to
practice it to learn it. By the way, "Synchronized Swimming for
Yodelers for the Brave and True" is due to be published in August of
20never. Check it out!

## Syntax

Clojure's syntax is simple. Like all Lisps, it employs a uniform
structure, a handful of special operators, and a constant supply of
parentheses delivered from the parenthesis mines hidden beneath the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Lisp was born.
